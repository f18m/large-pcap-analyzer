# Large PCAP file analyzer
Large PCAP file analyzer is a command-line utility program that performs some simple operations
on .PCAP files very quickly. This allows you to manipulate also very large PCAP files 
that cannot be easily handled with other software like <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.

Currently it builds and works on Linux but actually nothing prevents it from running on Windows.
It is based over the well-known libpcap.

Some features of this utility: 

1. Extract packets matching a simple BPF filter (tcpdump syntax).
2. Extract packets matching plain text.
3. Computes the tcpreplay speed required to respect packet timestamps.
4. Understands GTPu tunnelling and allows filtering via BPF filters (tcpdump syntax) the encapsulated (inner) GTPu frames.
5. Change PCAP duration, changing the timestamp inside each packet.

# Example run 1: time analysis

In this example we are interested in understanding how many seconds of traffic are contained in a PCAP file:

```
$ large_pcap_analyzer -t large.pcap 

No PCAP filter set: all packets inside the PCAP will be loaded.
8M packets (8751268 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
Tcpreplay should replay this PCAP at an average of 73.34Mbps / 14580.72pps to respect PCAP timings.
```

Note that to load a 5.6GB PCAP only 1.9secs were required (on a 3GHz Intel Xeon CPU).
This translates to a processing throughput of about 3GB/sec (in this mode).
RAM memory consumption was about 4MB.


# Example run 2: raw search

In this example we are interested in selecting any packet that may contain inside it the string "youtube":

```
$ large_pcap_analyzer -v -S "youtube" -w out.pcap bigcapture.pcap

Analyzing PCAP file 'bigcapture.pcap'...
The PCAP file has size 5.50GiB = 5636MiB.
No PCAP filter set: all packets inside the PCAP will be loaded.
Successfully opened output PCAP 'out.pcap'
1M packets loaded from PCAP...
2M packets loaded from PCAP...

Processing took 5 seconds.
8M packets (8751268 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
0M packets (9825 packets) matched the filtering criteria (search string / PCAP filters / valid TCP streams filter) and were saved into output PCAP.
```

Note that to load, search and extract packets from a 5.6GB PCAP only 5secs were required (on a 3GHz Intel Xeon CPU).
This translates to a processing throughput of about 1GB/sec (in this mode).
RAM memory consumption was about 4MB.


# Example run 3: tcpdump-like

In this example we are interested in selecting packets having a VLAN tag and directed or coming from an HTTP server:

```
$ large_pcap_analyzer -v -Y 'vlan and tcp port 80' -w out.pcap bigcapture.pcap

Successfully compiled PCAP filter: vlan and tcp port 80
Analyzing PCAP file 'bigcapture.pcap'...
The PCAP file has size 5.50GiB = 5636MiB.
Successfully opened output PCAP 'out.pcap'

8M packets loaded from PCAP (matching PCAP filter)...
Processing took 3 seconds.
8M packets (8751268 packets) were loaded from PCAP (matching PCAP filter).
0M packets (1147 packets) matched the filtering criteria (search string / PCAP filters / valid TCP streams filter) and were saved into output PCAP.
```

Note that to load, search and extract packets from a 2GB PCAP only 1sec was required (on a 3GHz Intel Xeon CPU).
RAM memory consumption was about 4MB.


# Example run 4: GTPu filtering

In this example we are interested in selecting packets GTPu-encapsulated for a specific TCP flow between the
IP address 1.1.1.1 <-> 1.1.1.2, on TCP ports 80 <-> 10000:


```
$ large_pcap_analyzer -v -G '(host 1.1.1.1 or host 1.1.1.2) and (port 80 or port 10000)' -w out.pcap bigcapture.pcap

Successfully compiled GTPu PCAP filter: (host 1.1.1.1 or host 1.1.1.2) and (port 80 or port 10000)
Analyzing PCAP file 'bigcapture.pcap'...
The PCAP file has size 5.50GiB = 5636MiB.
Successfully opened output PCAP 'out.pcap'
1M packets loaded from PCAP...
2M packets loaded from PCAP...
3M packets loaded from PCAP...
4M packets loaded from PCAP...
5M packets loaded from PCAP...
6M packets loaded from PCAP...
7M packets loaded from PCAP...
8M packets loaded from PCAP...
Processing took 3 seconds.
8M packets (8751268 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
8M packets (8501213 packets) loaded from PCAP are GTPu packets (97.1%).
0M packets (0 packets) matched the filtering criteria (search string / PCAP filters / valid TCP streams filter) and were saved into output PCAP.
```


# Example run 5: valid TCP stream filtering

In this example we are interested in selecting packets of TCP connections that have at least 1 SYN and 1 SYN-ACK packet
(if GTPu packets are found this analysis is done for the encapsulated TCP connections):

```
$ large_pcap_analyzer -v -T -w out.pcap bigcapture.pcap

Analyzing PCAP file 'bigcapture.pcap'...
The PCAP file has size 5.50GiB = 5636MiB.
Successfully opened output PCAP 'out.pcap'

4M packets loaded from PCAP...
5M packets loaded from PCAP...
6M packets loaded from PCAP...
7M packets loaded from PCAP...
8M packets loaded from PCAP...
Processing took 2 seconds.
Detected 1 invalid packets, 721214 non-TCP packets and 37436 valid TCP flows (on a total of 85878 flows).
Valid TCP filtering enabled: performing second pass
Analyzing PCAP file 'bigcapture.pcap'...
The PCAP file has size 5.50GiB = 5636MiB.

```

Note that to load, search and extract packets from a 5.6GB PCAP only 4.5secs were required (on a 3GHz Intel Xeon CPU).
This translates to a processing throughput of about 1GB/sec (in this mode).


# Example run 6: set PCAP duration resetting IFG

In this example a PCAP that would take 8 minutes to be replayed (without top speed option) will be
modified to take just 1.2 seconds to replay.
To better explain the result of the processing consider the following table where the original PCAP duration
is reset from 20secs down to 10secs using `--set-duration` option:

| Frame index | Frame relative time in original PCAP | Frame relative time in output PCAP |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1           | +0.0                                 | +0.0                               |
| 2           | +1.0                                 | +2.5                               |
| 3           | +15.0                                | +5.0                               |
| 4           | +18.0                                | +7.5                               |
| 5           | +20.0                                | +10.0                              |

See the following example session:

```
$ large_pcap_analyzer --timing test-pcaps/ipv4_gtpu_https.pcap
0M packets (18201 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
Last packet has a timestamp offset = 473.48sec = 7.89min = 0.13hours
Tcpreplay should replay this PCAP at an average of 0.27Mbps / 38.44pps to respect PCAP timings.

$ large_pcap_analyzer --set-duration 1.2 --write /tmp/test.pcap test-pcaps/ipv4_gtpu_https.pcap 
PCAP duration will be set to: 1.200000 secs
Successfully opened output PCAP '/tmp/test.pcap'
Packet processing operations require 2 passes: performing first pass
0M packets (18201 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
Packet processing operations require 2 passes: performing second pass
0M packets (18201 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
0M packets (18201 packets) were processed and saved into output PCAP.

$ large_pcap_analyzer --timing /tmp/test.pcap 
0M packets (18201 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
Last packet has a timestamp offset = 1.20sec = 0.02min = 0.00hours
Tcpreplay should replay this PCAP at an average of 105.00Mbps / 15167.50pps to respect PCAP timings.
```

Note that using `--set-duration` all timestamps in the resulting PCAP will have an equal inter-frame-gap (IFG). 
In other words the original IFGs will be lost.


# Example run 7: set PCAP duration preserving IFG

Repeating example #6 using `--set-duration-preserve-ifg` instead of `--set-duration` will give the same
result as far as the total PCAP duration is concerned, but the ratio between the new PCAP IFGs and the original
PCAP IFGs will be preserved.
To better explain the result of the processing consider the following table where the original PCAP duration
is scaled down by a factor of 10 using `--set-duration-preserve-ifg`:

| Frame index | Frame relative time in original PCAP | Frame relative time in output PCAP |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1           | +0.0                                 | +0.0                               |
| 2           | +1.0                                 | +0.1                               |
| 3           | +15.0                                | +1.5                               |
| 4           | +16.0                                | +1.6                               |

As you can see the inter-frame-gaps (IFGs) among the packets are preserved: the packet #4 in the original PCAP
has a timestamp difference from packet #1 equal to 16secs that become 1.6secs in the rescaled PCAP.
The same ratio is found considering the timestamp difference between packet #4 and packet #3: it is 1sec in
the original PCAP and 0.1sec in the rescaled output PCAP.

```
$ large_pcap_analyzer --set-duration-preserve-ifg 1.2 --write /tmp/test.pcap test-pcaps/ipv4_gtpu_https.pcap 
PCAP duration will be set to: 1.200000 secs
Successfully opened output PCAP '/tmp/test.pcap'
Packet processing operations require 2 passes: performing first pass
0M packets (18201 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
Packet processing operations require 2 passes: performing second pass
0M packets (18201 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
0M packets (18201 packets) were processed and saved into output PCAP.

$ large_pcap_analyzer --timing /tmp/test.pcap 
0M packets (18201 packets) were loaded from PCAP.
Last packet has a timestamp offset = 1.20sec = 0.02min = 0.00hours
Tcpreplay should replay this PCAP at an average of 105.00Mbps / 15167.50pps to respect PCAP timings.
```


# Example run 8: change PCAP timestamps

In this example the timestamps of 2 packets are manually tweaked.
First of all current timestamps are extracted using a tool like [tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html),
in Epoch format:

```
$ tshark -F pcap -r test-pcaps/timing-test.pcap -Tfields -e frame.time_epoch >pkts_timings.txt
```

Then the timestamps of the 10-th packet and 11-th packet are replaced with the absolute time "Saturday 9 February 2019 19:20:00",
corresponding to the Unix timestamp value 1549740000 (you can use an online tool like https://www.epochconverter.com/),
in the dump of packet timestamps:

```
$ sed -i '10s/.*/1549740000.000000000/' pkts_timings.txt
$ sed -i '11s/.*/1549740000.100000000/' pkts_timings.txt
```

Finally using the Large PCAP file analyzer tool, the capture trace is actually modified and the result is saved into the
"out.pcap" file:

```
$ large_pcap_analyzer --write out.pcap --set-timestamps-from pkts_timings.txt test-pcaps/timing-test.pcap
```
