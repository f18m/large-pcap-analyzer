%description
A command-line utility program that performs some simple operations on .PCAP files very quickly.
This allows you to manipulate also very large PCAP files that cannot be easily handled with other
software like Wireshark (or tshark). Supports filtering encapsulated GTPu frames.
Supports simple per-TCP-stream filtering. Easily extendible.
